# Flappy Plane
This project is a demonstration of how WebGL can be used to create a virtual
reality scene for web browsers on mobile phones.

## Installation
Our project uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool, both
are required in order to run the app locally. In order to build our web app and
launch it, execute the following from the repository root:

~~~
$ npm install
$ gulp serve
~~~

*NOTE: We have also gone ahead and hosted a version [here](https://tomasreimers.github.io/webgl-vr-demo/).*

## Use
When you open the webpage in a webbrowser (`index.html`), there will be three buttons at the bottom right of the app.

1. ABOUT: Link to a page describing the project and some of the technical
details behind it.

2. FIX: Toggles ego motion on and off.

3. VR: Enables stereoscopic viewing for mobile VR viewing.
