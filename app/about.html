    <h2>Impetus</h2>
    <p>  Virtual Reality (stereoscopic viewing through a specific headset,
    combined with gyroscope informed camera motion) has become increasingly
    popular over the past couple of years. This has been marked by an increase
    in 3D content, a proliferation of headsets, and public attention to the
    field from many big-name players, such as PlayStation, NVidia, and Google.
    One specific area of exploration has been VR on the web -- the reasoning
    being that it would be platform-independent and sandboxed using
    already-existing technologies. For example, see <a
    href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-the-react-vr-pre-release/">Oculusâ€™
    pre-release of ReactVR</a> a framework to build VR for the web. We wanted to
    explore this and demo how WebGL could be used to create immerse VR
    experiences on the web.  </p>

    <h2>Background on Google Cardboard</h2>
    <p>
        Google Cardboard was a revolutionary invention created by an engineer
        at Google in 2014. The device, made from a cardboard box and two lenses,
        allows anyone with a smartphone to experience virtual reality. The idea
        was born when an engineer realized that the expensive components
        required for virtual reality - a computer, high-resolution display,
        and motion sensors - all already existed on everyone's day-to-day
        smartphones. Since its creation, an estimated 5 million units have
        been shipped.
    </p>

    <h2>Background on WebGL</h2>
    <p>
        In the world's endeavor to make Javascript do everything it was never
        meant to do, WebGL was born. It is a Javascript API for rendering
        3D graphics on modern web browsers without the assistance of plugins.
        Beyond near universal support, WebGL is wonderful because it is able
        to utilize a computer's GPU while calculating what to render on screen,
        giving it much higher performance than otherwise possible. This is a
        must when considering programming for Virtual Reality, because two
        view points must be rendered simultaneously at a high framerate to
        generate a convincing experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Background on Three.js</h2>
    <p>
        Writing raw WebGL, similar to any GL, is a painful experience.
        Developers took note of this pain, and since WebGL's adoption, a variety
        of wrapper libraries have sprung up. One of the most popular WebGL
        wrappers is <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Three JS
        creates powerful classes such as Scenes, Renders, Cameras, Geometries,
        Materials, and Meshes. These classes abstract away some of the less
        pleasant aspects of 3D programming and allow users to focus on the
        arrangement and physics of their scene.
    </p>

    <h2>Rendering a scene in 3D</h2>
    <p>
        To create our beautiful plane flying in all its 3D glory, we create a
        Scene object from Three.js and append it to the DOM. In the creation of
        a scene object, we add in lights, dynamically generated clouds, a
        randomly shifting cylindrical ground, and of course, a small propeller
        plane. We found the low poly art style to be both appealing and
        feasible to create purely with code. The ambient and hemisphere light
        work to fade colors from the sky into the objects around the scene.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding ego-motion using the mouse</h2>
    <p>
        We wanted to give a dynamic interactivity to our scene. To do this, we
        connected the javascript callback for mouse movements to our camera
        object in the scene. When the user moves the mouse towards the edges of
        the screen, the camera pans in ego motion in the same direction. This
        gives the user the sense of presence and exploration as the curiously
        look around the scene.
    </p>

    <h2>Rendering for VR</h2>
    <p>
        Ego-motion on a laptop is nice, but we wanted to push ourselves to
        create a stereoscopic, motion tracking experience using Google Cardboard
        devices. If you load the web page on your phone, toggle VR, and place
        the phone into a VR viewer, you can look around our small world and
        the buzzing plane. Rather than using a single camera, we construct a
        digital camera rig complete with a perspective center camera, a left
        perspective camera, and a right perspective camera. When the user
        toggles VR, we switch from showing the view from the center camera,
        to showing a split screen with each of the two side cameras. When update
        camera is called from the runtime loop, we check the gyroscope position
        of the phone, and point the cameras appropriately. To prevent jitter, we
        use smooth linear interpolation rather than just setting the camera rig
        position directly.
