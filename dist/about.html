This has been marked by an increase in 3D content, a proliferation of headsets, and public attention to the field from many big-name players, such as PlayStation, NVidia, and Google. One specific area of exploration has been VR on the web -- the reasoning being that it would be platform-independent and sandboxed using already-existing technologies. For example, see <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-the-react-vr-pre-release/">Oculusâ€™ pre-release of ReactVR</a> a framework to build VR for the web. We wanted to explore this and demo how WebGL could be used to create immerse VR experiences on the web.</p><h2>Background on Google Cardboard</h2><p>Google Cardboard was a revolutionary invention created by an engineer at Google in 2014. The device, made from a cardboard box and two lenses, allows anyone with a smartphone to experience virtual reality. The idea was born when an engineer realized that the expensive components required for virtual reality - a computer, high-resolution display, and motion sensors - all already existed on everyone's day-to-day smartphones. Since its creation, an estimated 5 million units have been shipped.</p><h2>Background on WebGL</h2><p>In the world's endeavor to make Javascript do everything it was never meant to do, WebGL was born. It is a Javascript API for rendering 3D graphics on modern web browsers without the assistance of plugins. Beyond near universal support, WebGL is wonderful because it is able to utilize a computer's GPU while calculating what to render on screen, giving it much higher performance than otherwise possible. This is a must when considering programming for Virtual Reality, because two view points must be rendered simultaneously at a high framerate to generate a convincing experience.</p><h2>Background on Three.js</h2><p>Writing raw WebGL, similar to any GL, is a painful experience. Developers took note of this pain, and since WebGL's adoption, a variety of wrapper libraries have sprung up. One of the most popular WebGL wrappers is <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Three JS creates powerful classes such as Scenes, Renders, Cameras, Geometries, Materials, and Meshes. These classes abstract away some of the less pleasant aspects of 3D programming and allow users to focus on the arrangement and physics of their scene.</p><h2>Rendering a scene in 3D</h2><p>To create our beautiful plane flying in all its 3D glory, we create a Scene object from Three.js and append it to the DOM. In the creation of a scene object, we add in lights, dynamically generated clouds, a randomly shifting cylindrical ground, and of course, a small propeller plane. We found the low poly art style to be both appealing and feasible to create purely with code. The ambient and hemisphere light work to fade colors from the sky into the objects around the scene.</p><div class="video-div"><video width="320" height="240" autoplay loop><source src="images/plane.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div><h2>Adding ego-motion using the mouse</h2><p>We wanted to give a dynamic interactivity to our scene. To do this, we connected the javascript callback for mouse movements to our camera object in the scene. When the user moves the mouse towards the edges of the screen, the camera pans in ego motion in the same direction. This gives the user the sense of presence and exploration as the curiously look around the scene.</p><div class="video-div"><video width="320" height="240" autoplay loop><source src="images/plane_move_mouse.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div><h2>Rendering for VR</h2><p>Ego-motion on a laptop is nice, but we wanted to push ourselves to create a stereoscopic, motion tracking experience using Google Cardboard devices. If you load the web page on your phone, toggle VR, and place the phone into a VR viewer, you can look around our small world and the buzzing plane.</p><p></p>In order to make a stereoscopic view, we would need to have 2 views that were facing the same direction and kept and a constant distance. Rather than have our code update two cameras, we choose to create a "camera_rig" object and attach our two cameras to it at a fixed distance, we then updated the code to change the rotation of the camera_rig object, instead of the camera object (which would inherit the changes because it's a child of the rig).<p></p><p class="note">NOTE: We also had to update the aspect ratio to have a heigth of half of the full screen.</p><p></p>We are forcing our users to lock their phone in portrait mode (because it would be incredibly inconvenient if orientation was switching because the user moved their head while we were trying to render a VR scene). For this reason, we needed to render the camera scenes rotated 90 degrees.<p></p><div class="video-div"><img height="300" src="images/plane_vr.png" type="image/png"></div><h2>Using the device orientation API to allow head-movement</h2><p>Having stereoscopic view, we wanted to permit the user to move their head and have that linked to camera movement. To do that we use the device orientation API that gives you the rotation of the phone in 3D space.</p><div class="video-div"><img width="200" src="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-orientation-event-20160818/start.png"></div><p>The rotation is given in Tait-Bryan Euler (LINK THIS) angles of type Z-X'-Y''; however, the Y and Z coordinate are inverted between our world and the phone's world. To correct for this we swap the Y and Z coordinates (and then stay right hand oriented, we need to invert the Z rotation). We take this rotation and rotate it 90 degrees about the X axis (b/c phone faces down by default), and then 90 degrees about Z (because portrait, not landscape by default), and then we just bind the phone rotation to the camera rig.</p><h2>Effects of changing eye distance and angles</h2><p>Because we could, we experimented with the horizontal distance between the left and right perspective cameras. We notices that when the distance between them is 0, the world looks flat as expected. As we increased the distance between the two cameras, the world becomes more and more 3D. At a certain point, the distance becomes so large that you brain recognizes that they are two different images and your vision becomes a muddled mess.</p><h2>Resources Used</h2><p>https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/<br>http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-beginners-guide-to-three-js<br>https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/<br>https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-orientation-event-20160818/<br></p><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
